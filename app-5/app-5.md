Remember -- Stack Overflow and Google are strongly encouraged. 

**Expected Duration:** 2+ hours.

## Objectives
* Make your fifth app
* Make a non-ambiguous, fully-constrained UI
* Create a UI that remains responsive while fetching data from a server
* Gain autonomy in making apps

This app will have less guided instruction than previous ones; the final app will have even less. This is intended to prepare you for making a final project all by yourself. It's still extremely similar to what we did in class, so it shouldn't be too challenging 

## Topics
* Segues
* TableViews
* NavigationController
* URLSession
* Codable
* Firebase

## Getting Started
* Pick any api from this list of public and free apis: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
* As a note, api's with "OAuth" authentication are significantly harder to work with. I wouldn't recommend working with them but kudos to you if you do
* Some APIs like MapBox may not return any data. Please carefully select which API you choose to work with as some won't work and some are much much harder to work with than others 

## Milestone 1 Technical Requirements 
* Connect to your API using URLSession
* Utilize codable to decode data from your chosen API 
* Create a UI to display your API data 

## Milestone 2 Technical Requirements 
* Start a firebase project and connect it to your app from milestone 1 
* Link data that you retrieved from the API and store it inside a cloud firestore database 
* Remove your API key and confirm that your application still properly displays the original data from the API
