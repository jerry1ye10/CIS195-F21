Get through the first 3 sections of [this](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/1/overview) tutorial. The sections you must complete are: Setting Up, Listing File images with FileManager, and Designing our interface. 

It is extremely thorough and meant for beginners, so hopefully there shouldn't be too many questions. If there are, please make a post on piazza about it.
